- There are only two kinds of languages: The hated one & the one that no one uses
  
- you look like the type who disables password login and only trusts key-based authentication when using SSH…so tell me, what do I gotta do to be your id_rsa?
- Are you a kernel panic? Because my world stops when I see you
- Are you an update notification? Because I didn’t know I needed you until you showed up.
- Are you a semicolon? Because every time you're not around, everything falls apart.
